# NFT Checker - [Visit Test URL](https://super-kangaroo-bb3c20.netlify.app/)

I was tasked with implementing a feature that displays a list of NFTs (Non-Fungible
Tokens) of a given address.

# Requirements

- The list of NFTs should be displayed as a grid of cards, with each card displaying the NFT's details.
- When a user clicks on a card, a modal should be displayed that shows more details about the NFT, such as its description and the owner's address.
- The modal should have a button that allows the user to purchase the NFT. Clicking the button should navigate them to the relevant OpenSea page.
- The design of the grid of cards and the modal is up to you, but it should be visually appealing and easy to use.
